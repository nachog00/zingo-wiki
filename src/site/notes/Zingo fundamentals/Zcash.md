Zcash is a cryptocurrency that prioritizes privacy by leveraging [[Zingo fundamentals/Zero-knowledge proofs\|Zero-knowledge proofs]] to obscure transaction details on the blockchain. Unlike transparent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin where transaction data is publicly viewable, Zcash offers users the option to shield their transactions, making them confidential.

**How it works:**

Zcash utilizes a specific type of zero-knowledge proof called [[zk-SNARKs\|zk-SNARKs]]. When a user initiates a shielded transaction, zk-SNARKs allow the network to verify its validity without revealing any sensitive information such as the sender, recipient, or amount.

This verification process ensures that the transaction adheres to the network's rules (no double-spending, sufficient funds, etc.) while maintaining the privacy of the parties involved.

**Key benefits of Zcash's privacy features:**

- **Confidentiality:** Shielded transactions mask the sender, recipient, and amount, enhancing financial privacy.
- **Fungibility:** All Zcash units are interchangeable, as there is no way to distinguish between shielded coins based on their transaction history.
- **Selective disclosure:** Users retain control over their information and can choose to reveal transaction details if needed for audits or compliance.

**In essence, Zcash's utilization of zero-knowledge proofs empowers users to transact with a heightened level of privacy and control over their financial data, distinguishing it from transparent cryptocurrencies.**
