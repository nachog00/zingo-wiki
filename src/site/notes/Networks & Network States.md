## Notes
> Networks and network states that rely on community partic- ipation and collaboration can benefit from Quadratic Funding by incentivizing the develop- ment of public goods that im- prove the networkâ€™s infrastruc- ture, security, or usability. By allowing network participants to vote on funding allocation, blockchain networks can har- ness the collective wisdom of their communities to support projects that drive long-term growth and adoption.
