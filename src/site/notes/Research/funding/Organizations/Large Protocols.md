> Established blockchain proto- cols with substantial treasur- ies can leverage Quadratic Funding to incentivize the development of public goods that benefit the protocol’s ecosystem. By allowing token holders to vote on project funding, protocols can ensure that resources are allocated towards initiatives that con- tribute to the protocol’s growth and success.
